# Welcome to 64 Odyssey 🚀

First of all let's address the elephant in the room. 🐘 Why the name 64 Odyssey??? 🤔
Well Ascii Values of C = 67.
Therefore C++ = 68
And since it's a repository of C & C++ it equals to 64. 😂 Lol

A comprehensive collection of C and C++ programming exercises designed to guide you through the core concepts, algorithms, and data structures of programming. 📚 This repository is an essential toolkit for learners and enthusiasts aiming to master problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and efficient code writing. 💻

## What You'll Discover:

-   **Fundamentals of C Programming:** Operators, function prototypes, arrays, and pointers to build your programming foundation. 🧱
-   **String Manipulation & Advanced Techniques:** From basic string operations to swapping, sorting, and using string functions effectively. 🔤
-   **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Learn to allocate and manage memory efficiently. 💾
-   **Data Structures in Action:** Deep dive into linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 🌲
-   **Algorithms to Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:** Sorting, searching, recursion, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. 💡
-   **Graph Theory:** Explore adjacency matrices, lists, and algorithms to solve graph-related challenges. 🕸️
-   **Tree Algorithms:** Covering binary trees, AVL trees, diameter, subtree sums, and lowest common ancestors (LCA). 🌳
-   **More to Come:** Dynamic Programming techniques, including top-down and bottom-up approaches, tabular methods, and more. ✨
