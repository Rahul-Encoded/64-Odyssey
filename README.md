# Welcome to 64 Odyssey

First of all let's address the elephant in the room. Why the name 64 Odyssey???
Well Ascii Values of C = 67.
Therefore C++ = 68
And since it's a repository of C & C++ it eauals to 64. Lol

A comprehensive collection of C and C++ programming exercises designed to guide you through the core concepts, algorithms, and data structures of programming. This repository is an essential toolkit for learners and enthusiasts aiming to master problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and efficient code writing.

## What You'll Discover:

- **Fundamentals of C Programming:** Operators, function prototypes, arrays, and pointers to build your programming foundation.
- **String Manipulation & Advanced Techniques:** From basic string operations to swapping, sorting, and using string functions effectively.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Learn to allocate and manage memory efficiently.
- **Data Structures in Action:** Deep dive into linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms to Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:** Sorting, searching, recursion, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Graph Theory:** Explore adjacency matrices, lists, and algorithms to solve graph-related challenges.
- **Tree Algorithms:** Covering binary trees, AVL trees, diameter, subtree sums, and lowest common ancestors (LCA).
- **More to Come:** Dynamic Programming techniques, including top-down and bottom-up approaches, tabular methods, and more.

## Why Use This Repository?

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, brushing up on your programming skills, or building a strong conceptual base, **Code Odyssey** provides a structured and well-documented approach to problem-solving in C/C++.
